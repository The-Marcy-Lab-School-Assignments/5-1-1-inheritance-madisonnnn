# Question
What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

# Answer
An `instance` method is a function that belongs to a class and can access instances within and a `class` method uses `static` to make the method belong to the class ~~and cannot access instance attributes~~.

# Teacher Feedback

You are correct in that we need to use static to make a class method.

 We call instance methods on instances that need to first be created, after creation then we can invoke those instance methods. Class methods can be called on the class directly!
