# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism is when a class takes (inherits) a method or function from a parent class. You can inherit methods and properties from a parent class and use it for a sub class.

class Pet {
  constructor(name,type){
    this.name = name
    this.type = type
  }
  speak(){
    console.log('the pet speaks')
  }
}

class Dog extends Pet {
  constructor(name){
      super(name,type)
    }
}

Dog.speak() // logs 'the pet speaks'
