# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism is when a class takes a method or function from a parent class. You can inherent methods from a parent class and use it for a sub class.

class Pet {
  speak(){
    console.log('the pet speaks')
  }
}

class Dog extends Pet {

}

Dog.speak() // logs 'the pet speaks'
